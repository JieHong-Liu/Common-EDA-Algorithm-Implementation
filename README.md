# Common-EDA-Algorithm-Implementation
I implement some common algorithm in EDA. 

`MST/Kruskal.cpp` Implement Kruskal's algorithm to calculate the total wirelength of Minimum Rectilinear Spanning Tree on C++.

`wirelength/log_sum.py`, `wirelength/WA.py` : calculate the wirelength by model logSumExp and WA.
